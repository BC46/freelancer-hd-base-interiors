An addon for the game Freelancer (2003) that replaces all existing base interior and planetscape textures with HD ones.

This includes the base interiors and planetscapes for the following categories:
* Bretonia
* Generic
* Kusari
* Liberty
* Pirate
* Rheinland

All original textures have been upscaled by 400% using [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) and [SwinIR](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR), so 256x256 becomes 1024x1024, etc. The upscaling technology has allowed the quality of the textures to be improved without affecting their original look. Additionally, the upscaled textures have been adjusted and improved manually.

All files from this addon may be freely used by any mod or anything else. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-base-interiors-and-planetscapes/blob/main/LICENSE) file for more information.
